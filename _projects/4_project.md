<h4> Project description: </h4>
Many real world problems involve multiple objectives to be satisfied concurrently subject to some constraints. Solution to such problems involve a set of solutions each of which canâ€™t be improved in one objective without deteriorating in another. We say these solutions are <b>non-dominated</b> with respect to one another. <b>Evolutionary algorithms </b> are particularly suitable for solving such problems due to the property of achieving the entire set of solution in one single run.

Problems involving more than three objectives are commonly known as <b>Many-objective Optimization Problems</b>. Since the number of non-dominated solutions increases
exponentially with increase in the number of objectives, many-objective optimisation problems are challenging to solve. The objective is to devise an algorithm for solving many-objective optimisation problems.

<h4> Contributions: </h4>
In my undergraduate thesis, in collaboration with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/siddhartha047/"> Siddhartha Shankar Das</a>, I adopted the notion of fuzzy-dominance to solve many-objective optimisation problems. Later Siddhartha adopted the notion of reference points to develop a new algorithm that significantly improves the performance of our algorithm.
