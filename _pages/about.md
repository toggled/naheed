I am broadly interested in algorithms for higher-order data. How to design efficient algorithms for hypergraph structured data mining, How to visualise hypergraphs, How to generate realistic synthetic hypergraphs- I have investigated such questions in the realm of higher-order data mining.

I am also invested in various real-world applications/implications of graph and hypergraph learning. For instance, At Rolls-Royce@NTU Corp lab, I designed GNNs to accelerate flow field prediction on high-resolution mesh by exploiting low-resolution simulations (super-resolution problem). 

I was a Research Fellow at Rolls-Royce Corporate Lab@NTU from 2021-2023. Prior to that, I graduated from National University of Singapore (NUS) in Nov, 2020. I was also an RA at NUS school of computing in 2019 and post-doc in the deparment of information systems from 2020-21.
