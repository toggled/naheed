Naheed Anjum Arafat is a researcher with extensive experience as a Research Fellow at Rolls-Royce@NTU Corporate Lab, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore (2021-2024). At RR@NTU Corp Lab, Naheed contributed to cutting-edge advancements in graph-based AI for computational physics simulation. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore (2020), specializing in hypergraphs (higher-order graphs) and topological data analysis. 

Naheed's expertise encompasses graph representation learning, adversarially robust learning, and hypergraph data mining, with applications in cybersecurity, computational physics, and human-centered AI. His contributions have been recognized through publications in premier venues such as ICML, ICLR, AAAI, VLDB, among others as well as a patent granted by the UK Intellectual Property Office.

# I am also interested in real-world applications of machine learning, for instance, in [physics domain](https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/poster/33839). At Rolls-Royce@NTU Corp lab, I designed GNNs to accelerate flow field prediction on high-resolution mesh by exploiting low-resolution simulations (super-resolution problem).
