# Reminder to myself
* source branch: holds the content created/edited/updated by me.
* master branch: holds the content generated by deploy script.
* Run `bin/deploy --user` to deploy the generated pages to master branch.
* Manually run `git push origin source` to ensure source branch is up-to-date with my local copy.
* When I need to update any content- 
  - run appropriate `git add/rm [filepath]` command,
  - followed by, commit message,
  - followed by, `git push origin source` command,
